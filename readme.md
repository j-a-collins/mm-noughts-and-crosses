# Minimax Noughts and Crosses Game

This is a quick [noughts and crosses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game in which the user plays against a rudimentary A.I, a basic Minimax algorithm.

[Minimax](https://encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=Minimax_principle) is a backtracking algorithm used in decision-making to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent also plays optimally. It's perfect for turn-based games like noughts and crosses, so I decided to make a short game to utilise minimax.
In Minimax the two players are called maximiser and minimiser. The maximiser tries to achieve the highest score possible while the minimiser tries to do the opposite and get the lowest score possible.

**Current state**: complete, no plans to expand. It's just a short, dumb game. PRs welcome if you find any breaks or problems
